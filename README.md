### src-composition-api

- **Composition API**: Written using the syntax. `<script setup>`
- **Props and Events**: Utilizes `defineProps` to receive data and `defineEmits` to send data to a parent component.
- **Computed Properties**: Employs `computed` for dynamic calculations, such as for class bindings.
- **Composables**: Leverages reusable logic extracted into composable functions (e.g., ). `useNumbers.ts`

### src-micro-blog

- **State Management**: Manages application state centrally through a reactive `store`.
- **Component Composition**: Builds the UI by importing and using child components like `Card` and `Controls`.
- **Reactivity**: Uses `computed` properties to create derived state that updates automatically, such as a filtered list
  of posts.
- **List Rendering & Slots**: Renders lists with and uses to pass template fragments into child components.
  `v-for``v-slot`
- **TypeScript**: Integrates TypeScript within the block for enhanced type safety. `<script setup>`

### src-pokemon

- **Reusable Components**: Provides UI building blocks, such as the `Card` component, designed for use across different
